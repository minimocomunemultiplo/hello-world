This is an example. Hope it works.
I am a student named Giacomo Panza, here at Bologna University. I am enrolled in a master program now about nature studies and conservation. I enjoy getting deep into geology and astrobiology. I got really interested in Geographic information systems (GIS) and coding (mostly with R), so I am curious to learn more on how to apply these systems to other planets or space environments.
My science goes the same pace with music, so I produce my solo project since long now, I think it started in 2017, after our band took a drift.
